In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object properties, specifically when using the `->` operator to access them.  The issue is often rooted in a misunderstanding of PHP's type handling and how it interacts with null values.

```php
class MyClass {
    public $property;
}

$object = new MyClass();

// The problematic line
echo $object->property->anotherProperty; 
```

If `$object->property` is null, the code will throw a fatal error. The error isn't caught gracefully because trying to access `anotherProperty` on a `null` value isn't handled by PHP naturally, unlike some languages that might return null.
